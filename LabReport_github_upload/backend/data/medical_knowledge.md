# Lab Test Knowledge Base

## Hemoglobin
Low hemoglobin can occur due to iron deficiency, blood loss, or chronic illness.
Mild low values are often manageable with diet, supplements, and follow-up care.
High hemoglobin can occur with dehydration, smoking, or living at high altitude.

## White Blood Cells (WBC)
WBC count rises during infections, inflammation, stress, and sometimes steroid use.
Low WBC can happen due to viral infections, medications, or bone marrow suppression.
A single mild abnormality does not always indicate serious disease.

## Platelets
Platelets help with blood clotting.
Low platelets may increase bleeding risk if very low.
High platelets may occur after infection or inflammation and can normalize later.

## Glucose
Fasting glucose reflects blood sugar control.
Slightly high fasting glucose can improve with activity, weight management, and nutrition.
Persistent elevation should be reviewed for diabetes screening.

## Cholesterol
LDL contributes to artery plaque; HDL helps remove cholesterol from blood.
Lifestyle changes including exercise, reduced saturated fat, and fiber intake can help.
Interpretation should include age, blood pressure, smoking status, and diabetes risk.

## Kidney Function
Creatinine is used to assess kidney filtration.
Hydration, muscle mass, and medications can affect creatinine levels.
Trends over time are often more useful than one isolated value.

## Communication Style
Use non-alarming language.
Explain what the test does, whether the result is above/below range, and practical next steps.
Encourage patient follow-up without causing fear.
